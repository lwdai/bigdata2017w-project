# Community Detection Algorithms

> The goal of our project is to implement two graph algorithms
using Spark GraphX in Big Data platform. As a powerful
data processing framework, Spark has been adopted by a
wide range of big enterprises such as Net
ix, Yahoo, to develop
software products. Spark not only inherits the characteristics
of map-reduce but provides many features that
cannot be performed by MapReduce. We decide to learn
an important component of Spark, GraphX, which outperforms
most of the graph systems with 
exibility and fault
tolerance. In this course, we have learned the basic infrastructure
of both map-reduce and spark in details. To detect
community structure in graphs, many researchers have studied
the problem and they have achieved great progress. Our
project chooses two popular graph algorithms for community
detection and implements them in both local environment
and Altiscale using unweighted graph data from twitter and
youtube. All of our work can be reached in github reposities.
